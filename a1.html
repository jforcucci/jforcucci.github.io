    <h1>Assignment #1: Blink</h1>

      <h3>Schematic and Calculations</h3>
       <img src="IMG_0040.jpg" />
      <p> I decided to try adding a blue LED as a challenge.
        I calculate the resistance for the green and yellow LEDs as 160, and 85 
        for the blue. This makes sense, since blue requires a higher voltage and
        therefore a lower resistor. To be safe, I rounded each number up for the 
        resistor I ended up choosing: 220 for yellow/green, and 100 for blue.
        I also experimented with a higher resistor to make the blue bulb a bit dimmer.
        I recreated the circuit with a 1k resistor and you can see in the gif that the blue 
        is slightly dim.

      <h3>Circuit</h3>

      <p> I purposefully used a resistor that was too high for this 
        iteration of the circuit, which is why the blue bulb is dimmed.

      <h3>Additional Questions</h3>
      <b>1: Draw a graph where the X axis is time and the 
        Y axis is voltage across the LEDs. Draw a line for each of your 3 LEDs.</b>
      <img src="IMG_0041.jpg" />
      <p> Here is a graphical representation of each 
        color-coded LED flashing in succession with one second in between each 
        second-long flash. The voltage peaks and holds for a second for each LED,
        before dropping for a second and repeating with the next LED

      <b>Q2: How many LEDs could you 
        blink independently with your Arduino? How much current would that draw?
      </b>
      <p> You could blink 14 LEDs because there are 14 pins on the Arduino.
        This would result in a current of .2Amps * 14 pins = 2.8 amps

      <b>
        4: How fast do you need to blink your 
        LEDs until you no longer can tell that they are blinking?
      </b>
      <p>
        I can't tell when they are blinking at 10ms.

         Did you use AI tools in completing this assignment? If yes, please provide details on how/when, as well as a brief reflection. If no, you can either leave this question blank,
        or provide other information if you'd like.

      <p>
        Yes, but I just used it to figure out how to add a line break in my HTML.
        It told me to use the br tag which I have been using to help with 
        formatting my HTML page. I didn't even intend to use AI, I just googled 
        it and the gemini AI summary came up, describing how to add a line break.
        Apart from that, I didn't use any AI tools.
