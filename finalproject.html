      <h2>Project Concept
      </h2>
      <p> I want to build a motion sensor- triggered light that turns on when I walk into my room. I also want it to also slowly rotate and turn on and off by touch.
    </p>
      <br><br>
      <h2>
       Anticipated Bill of Materials: 
      </h2>
      <p>
        RGB LED strips (for a light source)
Stepper motor (for rotation)
Assorted resistors (for current-limiting)
Microcontroller (Arduino Uno)
Breadboard
3d printed base
PIR sensor (motion sensing)
Capacitive sensor (touch sensing)
Power supply
Transistor
Yarn/beads for a decorative shade

      </p>
      <br><br>
      <h2>
        Timeline:
      </h2>
      <p>
        1. Draw schematic
2. Gather materials 
3. Electronic components
A. Get sensors working (capacitive + motion)
B. Get output working (lighting + stepper motor)
4. 3d print base to house components 
5. Connect base to lights and stepper motor

      </p>

      <br><br>
      <h2>
        Contingency Plan
      </h2>
      <p>
        I anticipate that the rotation will be the most difficult aspect of this project. I will leave that part out if it is too difficult to implement, or add a different rotating piece
I am also considering using fairy lights rather than LED strips, which may require additional components
