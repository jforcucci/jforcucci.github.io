      <h2>Project Concept
      </h2>
      <p> I want to build a motion sensor- triggered light that turns on when I walk into my room. I also want it to also slowly rotate and turn on and off by touch.
    </p>

      <h2>
       Anticipated Bill of Materials: 
      </h2>
      <p>
  

     
      <ul>
        <li>RGB LED strips (for a light source)</li>
        <li>Stepper motor (for rotation)</li>
        <li>Assorted resistors (for current-limiting)</li>
        <li>Microcontroller (Arduino Uno)</li>
        <li>Breadboard</li>
        <li>3d printed base</li>
        <li>PIR sensor (motion sensing)</li>
        <li>Capacitive sensor (touch sensing)</li>
        <li>Power supply</li>
        <li>Transistor</li>
        <li>Yarn/beads for a decorative shade</li>
      </ul>

       </p>

      <h2>
        Timeline:
      </h2>
      <p>
        <ul>
            <li> 1 Draw schematic and gather materials </li>
            <li> 2 Get sensors working (capacitive + motion) </li>
            <li> 3 Get output working (lighting + stepper motor) </li>
            <li> 4 print base to house components </li>
            <li> 5 Connect base to lights and stepper motor </li>
        </ul>

      </p>

      <h2>
        Contingency Plan
      </h2>
      <p>
        I anticipate that the rotation will be the most difficult aspect of this project. I will leave that part out if it is too difficult to implement, or add a different rotating piece
I am also considering using fairy lights rather than LED strips, which may require additional components
